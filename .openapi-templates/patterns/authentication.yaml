# Authentication Patterns

## Usage
Copy the relevant security schemes into your spec's components section.
Apply security requirements to protected endpoints.

## Types Available
- Bearer Token (JWT)
- API Key (Header or Query)
- OAuth 2.0
- HTTP Basic Auth

components:
  securitySchemes:
    # Bearer Token (JWT)
    bearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      bearerFormat: JWT
      description: |
        JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:
        `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

    # API Key in Header
    apiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key
      description: |
        API Key authentication. Include your API key in the X-API-Key header:
        `X-API-Key: <your-api-key>`

    # API Key in Query Parameter
    apiKeyQuery:
      type: apiKey
      in: query
      name: api_key
      description: |
        API Key authentication via query parameter:
        `?api_key=<your-api-key>`

    # OAuth 2.0 with multiple flows
    oauth2:
      type: oauth2
      description: OAuth 2.0 authentication
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://auth.example.com/oauth/authorize
          tokenUrl: https://auth.example.com/oauth/token
          scopes:
            read: Read access to resources
            write: Write access to resources
            admin: Administrative access
        clientCredentials:
          tokenUrl: https://auth.example.com/oauth/token
          scopes:
            read: Read access to resources
            write: Write access to resources

    # HTTP Basic Authentication
    basicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
      description: |
        Basic authentication using username and password.
        Credentials are base64 encoded in the Authorization header:
        `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>`

# Usage Examples:

# Apply to all operations globally (add to root level):
# security:
#   - bearerAuth: []

# Apply to specific operations:
# paths:
#   /protected:
#     get:
#       security:
#         - bearerAuth: []
#       responses:
#         '200':
#           description: Success
#         '401':
#           $ref: '#/components/responses/Unauthorized'

# Multiple authentication options (OR logic):
# paths:
#   /flexible:
#     get:
#       security:
#         - bearerAuth: []
#         - apiKeyAuth: []
#       # User can authenticate with either bearer token OR API key

# Multiple requirements (AND logic):
# paths:
#   /strict:
#     get:
#       security:
#         - bearerAuth: []
#           apiKeyAuth: []
#       # User must provide both bearer token AND API key

# OAuth with specific scopes:
# paths:
#   /admin:
#     post:
#       security:
#         - oauth2: [admin, write]
#       # Requires 'admin' and 'write' scopes
