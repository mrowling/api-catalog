# REST CRUD Template Guide

## When to Use

Use this template when the user description includes:
- "CRUD operations"
- "REST API"
- "Create, read, update, delete"
- "Standard resource management"
- "RESTful endpoints"

## Features

This template provides:
- Standard REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- List with pagination
- Individual resource retrieval
- Create, update, delete operations
- Common error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Entities Included

- Generic Resource schema (customize based on user needs)

## Customization Guide

1. **Rename "Resource"** to user's actual entity (User, Post, Product, etc.)
2. **Add entity-specific properties** to the schema
3. **Add filtering parameters** if user mentions filtering/search
4. **Add relationships** if user mentions related entities
5. **Consider soft delete** vs hard delete based on requirements
